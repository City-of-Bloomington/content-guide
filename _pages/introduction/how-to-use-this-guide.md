title: How to use this guide

This guide was developed for City of Bloomington Employees employees, but we hope it’s a useful reference for anyone.

## Introduction

This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and meets people where they are. Government websites often talk _at_ readers rather than _to_ or _with_ them. As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.

This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web. Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner.
