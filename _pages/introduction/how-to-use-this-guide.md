title: How to use this guide
---

This guide was developed for City of Bloomington Employees employees, but we hope it’s a useful reference for anyone.

## Introduction

This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and meets people where they are. Government websites often talk _at_ readers rather than _to_ or _with_ them. As with other facets of its online presence, .gov writing tends to describe the government’s concerns in “governmentese,” leaving users frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor understandable.

This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web. Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner.

## If you work at City of Bloomington

We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis. It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word _federal_, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

To this end, we’ve structured the guide into descriptively named sections. Find the topic you’re looking for in our table of contents, or search by keyword. We aren’t opposed if you’d like to read this guide start to finish, of course.
